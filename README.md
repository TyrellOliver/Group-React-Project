# Your One Stop Sandiwch Shop

One-Stop Sandiwch Shop is a user-friendly React-based web application that provides an online ordering experience for their users to create their own sandwich by building it from the bottom to the top. We offer a comprehensive selection of sandwich ingredients and give the customer full control to have it their way. We also offer a selection of signature sandwiches which have been hand-selected by each of our chefs for those who want to try something different or those who can't make a decision. 

1. Custom Sandwich Builder: Users can choose from a wide range of bread, meats, cheeses, vegetables, sauces, and condiments to create their own unique sandwich combination.

2. Additional Items Available: We also offer a selection of snacks|chips and bottled beverages to satisfy everyone's hunger and thirst.

3. Ordering and Checkout: After customers finish creating their sandwiches and adding snacks or beverages to their cart, they will have the opportunity to view their order during checkout before submitting it online for pickup.

4. Pick-up Time and Special Requests: Orders will be ready for pick-up 30 minutes after they are submitted. There is a customer note section available to notify us of any changes or special requests, including if a later pick-up time is needed.

5. Weather: The current local weather conditions are available on our homepage for customers before they leave to pick-up their order. 

6. Payment: Payment will be made when picking up the order. We accept all major credit cards, EBT cards and cash.
